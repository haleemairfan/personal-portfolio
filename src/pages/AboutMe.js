                I'm a Year 2 Computer Science student at NUS, <br/>
                driven by a passion for developing technology <br/>
                that truly serves people. Iâ€™m interested in building <br/>
                tools and solutions that 
                <span className="highlight"> solve real-world problems</span>
                , <br/>
                with a focus on enhancing quality of life. <br/>
                My goal is to create 
                <span className="highlight"> user-centered products</span>
                <br/>
                that are optimized not only from a technical <br/>
                perspective but also from a user standpoint, <br/>
                ensuring they are meaningful in everyday lives.
